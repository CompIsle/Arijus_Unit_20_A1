  <h1>CSS Box Model</h1>
  <p>
    The box model is usually reffered as design and layout of the HTML webpage which consists of margin, padding, border and content. The CSS box model is a box that forms around HTML elements,
    which displays content on your website. If you want to style the content on your webpage, you can use the box model rules to display the content.

    <br>
    Each box model has 4 major factors, which are Margin, Borders, Padding and Content. The picture above shows how the box model is like when it is constructed inside a webpage. 
    All four parts can have different settings to the width, colour and any others. It also has a huge part on the user, as he's the designer so he can pick what specific settings he wants
    to have on the box model.

    <h1>Elements of the Box Model</h1>
    <p>Margin - This is the edge of the box, it's transparent displays the space between the element and other box models terms on the page, they can also collapse into
      on another, so that the margin from the top and bottom margin of one element can join up.
      <br>
      <br>
      Examples:
      <br>
      margin-top: 50px;
      margin-bottom: 50px;
      margin-right: 50px;
      margin-left: 50px;
      <br>
      <br>
      Border - Is another box model term which surrounds the box, the borders can be coloured or can even be transparent. The border can be set to the lowest, it being 0 so it goes to
      the border edge the same as the padding. This term can be used to decorate your webpage, or to display content on it.
      <br>
      <br>
      Examples:
      <br>
      border-style: dashed;
      border-width: 50px;
      <br>
      <br>
      Padding - It's the space between the content and the border, padding is the same as the colour as the background colour for the box. Similarly to the border, if the padding is set to the lowest, 
      being 0, the padding border is the same as the next box model term.
      <br>
      <br>
      Examples:
  
      <br>
      padding-top: 25px;
      padding-bottom: 25px;
      padding-left: 30px;
      padding-right: 50px;
      <br>
      <br>
      Content -  Is the element of the box, normally shows the text or image which is displayed inside the box. Therefore the content displays the most important features of the webpage.
       
      <h3>Selectors:</h3>
      <xmp>
        <style>
          p{
            color: blue;
            background-color: burlywood;
          }
        </style>
      </xmp>
      <p>Element: An example of this would be a <xmp><p></p></xmp> tag, if the element selector selects all of these tags, then in the entire document, anywhere on the page the 
    text of all paragraphs will have a blue text and a burlywood background.
    </p>
    Class: Selects any element with the class name, for example "groupclass". The dot in front of the name itself is a refferal to say that this is a class name.
    <xmp>
    <style>
      .groupclass{
color: red;
background-color:cyan

      }
    </style>
    </xmp>
All of the objects which will have a: <xmp><div class="groupclass">Text Example</div> 
  
  next to it, will appear to have a red text colour and a cyan background.</xmp>

    </p>
  </p>


   </p>
